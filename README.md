# Analysis of CO2 Emission Trends Using Python

## Introduction

This project explores global carbon emission trends using Python, employing data analysis techniques with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express. The goal is to understand the drivers of carbon emissions and their impact on environmental sustainability by analyzing factors such as population, GDP, and policy interventions.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to analyze carbon emission trends and identify regions with high emission levels. By leveraging data analysis techniques, we aim to gain insights into environmental sustainability and inform strategies for reducing carbon emissions globally.

## Data Analysis Process

1. Asking Questions
2. Data Wrangling
   - Gathering Data
   - Assessing Data
   - Cleaning Data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Drawing Conclusions
5. Communicating Results

## Data Wrangling

### Data Gathering

- Sources include CSV files, APIs, web scraping, and databases.

### Data Assessing and Cleaning

- The dataset contains 46,523 rows and 74 columns, focusing on various emission indicators from 1750 to 2021. The analysis targets the period from 2000 to 2021, concentrating on CO2 emissions.

### Key Columns

- `year`: Year of data recording
- `iso_code`: ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes
- `country`: Country names
- `population`: Population of each country
- `gdp`: Gross Domestic Product
- `co2`: Total carbon dioxide emissions
- `co2_per_capita`: Carbon dioxide emissions per capita

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Univariate Analysis

- Analyzing the distribution of numerical and categorical data.

### Bivariate Analysis

- Exploring relationships between numerical and categorical variables.

## Use Cases

1. **Trend of CO2 Emission over Decades**
   - Insight: CO2 emissions have increased due to rising population and industrial activities.
   
2. **Distribution and Trend of CO2 Emission Around the World**
   - Insight: China, USA, India, and Russia are top emitters; Africa and South America are mid-level emitters.

3. **Trend of CO2 Emission in Each Continent Over the Years**
   - Insight: Emission trends vary, with Asia seeing a significant increase, while Europe and North America show a decrease.

4. **Top 5 CO2 Emitting Countries Over Time**
   - Insight: Rapid industrialization in China and India has led to exponential emission increases.

5. **Historical Emissions**
   - Insight: China has consistently been the highest emitter in the 21st century.

6. **Highest Emission Levels by Continent**
   - Insight: Asia is the highest emitting continent.

7. **Country-Specific Emissions**
   - Insight: China has the highest emissions, with six of the top ten emitting countries being Asian.

8. **Asia’s Contribution to Global Emissions**
   - Insight: Over half of the world’s CO2 emissions come from Asia.

9. **Relationship Between Population and Emissions**
   - Insight: More populous countries tend to have higher CO2 emissions.

10. **CO2 Emission Per Capita Trends by Continent**
    - Insight: Australia has the highest per capita emissions; Asia has the third-lowest.

11. **CO2 Emission Per Capita Trends by Country**
    - Insight: The USA has the highest per capita emissions, although declining over time, while China’s emissions are increasing rapidly.

12. **Top 10 CO2 Emitters Per Capita**
    - Insight: The USA, Canada, and South Korea are the top per capita emitters.

13. **Relationship Between GDP and Emissions**
    - Insight: Wealthier countries produce more CO2 per person; GDP correlates positively with CO2 emissions.

## Conclusion

- The analysis of carbon emission trends reveals the urgent need for proactive measures to reduce emissions. Targeted interventions are necessary for rapidly industrializing economies, and tailored strategies are needed for different regions. Collaborative efforts are essential to transition to low-carbon economies and achieve environmental sustainability.
